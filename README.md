## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Python is not installed" (Mac/Windows launchers)
The app will guide you! It'll open python.org where you can download it.

### "Permission denied" or "Can't be opened" (Mac)
Right-click the app → **Open** → Click **Open** in the dialog. macOS will remember your choice.

### "Windows protected your PC" (Windows)
Click **More info** → **Run anyway**. This happens because the app isn't code-signed (that costs $$).

### OCR not working
Make sure Tesseract is installed:
- **Mac**: `brew install tesseract`
- **Windows**: Download from [tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
- **Linux**: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`

### Still stuck?
[Open an issue](../../issues) with:
- Your operating system (Mac/Windows/Linux)
- The error message you're seeing
- A sample PDF if possible (or just the platform name like "JSTOR")
