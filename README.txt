RoboStripper 👠✨💅
==================

Strips metadata junk from scholarly PDFs so you can upload
clean text to RoboBraille for audio conversion.

What's "metadata"? Those copyright stamps, download timestamps,
and platform URLs that appear on every page of your PDF. Screen
readers and RoboBraille read them aloud on every page — annoying!
RoboStripper removes them.


HOW TO USE
----------

1. Double-click the file for your computer:

   Mac:      "START HERE — Mac"
   Windows:  "START HERE — Windows"
   Linux:    "START HERE — Linux"

   (If Python isn't installed, it'll open the download page for you.)

2. Drag your PDF files into the window and press Enter.

3. Cleaned .txt files appear in the "output" folder.

4. Upload them to robobraille.org — the filename is already
   on your clipboard, just paste it in the file picker.


THAT'S IT!
